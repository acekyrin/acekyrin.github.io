<p> Getting involved in the campus radio station turned out to be one of the best decisions I had made as a college student.  Never before was I equipped with so much technology and influence all at my fingertips. </p>
<p>I began my venture into the world of broadcast journalism by becoming a volunteer at the Radio Reading Service my freshman year.  The concept was simple: read newspaper articles on-air, tuned to a specific frequency which blind residents had access to.  The following summer I became an independent radio correspondent for our NPR affiliate on campus. Here is one of the stories I covered for 89.1 WUFT-FM</p>

Last fall, I was a producer and anchor for our 30-minute afternoon show, "The Frontpage." Below is one of the feature stories I created, an example of the content I generated on a weekly basis.
