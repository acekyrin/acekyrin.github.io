            <div class="about">
<p>My name is Adam Gerstenfeld and I am a second-year Telecommunications student at the University of Florida, double-majoring in Telecommunications and International Studies.  My dream is to be an international news correspondent in the Middle East.</p> </br />
<p>However, not only has my school prepared me well in the professional field, it has also brought me to passions I never knew existed.  At school I work as a Resident Assistant in the oldest Residence Hall on campus.  I also have the pleasure of serving as UF’s first Interfaith Cabinet Director. </p> </br />

<p>For me personally, the spectrum of experiences I have undergone at this University has made my writing become so much more alive. I first started as a journalist when I was a senior in high school. I was looking at different scholarships to apply to, and one caught my attention immediately: the <a href="http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/paf/MaxwellScholarship/index.asp" target="_blank" title="Maxwell School of Citizenship Competition">Maxwell School of Citizenship Competition</a>.</p></br />
<p> The task was to find a community problem and write a full report to a city commissioner detailing a solution.  I was hooked immediately. From there, I decided to do some investigative work into flooding issues in a neighboring county, interviewing city engineers, FEMA representatives, even city commissioner <a href="https://services.ppines.com/ppines-2/castillo.html" target="_blank" title="Angelo Castillo Commissioner Page" >Angelo Castillo</a>!</p> </br />
<p> I was lucky enough to be selected as a finalist.  As this was my first venture into the world of investigative journalism, I was immediately inspired to follow this new pursuit in college - and I have never looked back.</p> </br />
<p>Aside from reporting, my hobbies include rock climbing and yoga.  I have also become extremely interested in professional photography, and you can view some of my pictures on my flickr account.</p></br />
